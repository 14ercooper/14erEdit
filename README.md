### On version numbering

##### PREFIX vA.B.C-POSTFIX

The prefix specifies which Minecraft version a backdated release is intended for. If no prefix is specified, the Spigot/Minecraft version to be used is the most recent as of the release date.

`A` specifies the major release number. This is only incremented when massive rewrites of the code are performed.

`B` specifies the minor release number. This tells you which minor release of the plugin this is. Higher numbers have more features

`C` specifies the bugfix version number. This tells you the bugfix patch of the plugin.

The POSTFIX takes one of two values, or is omitted.
 - SNAPSHOT Means a version where some of the features are not yet implemented
 - UNSTABLE Means a version that has not yet been tested for stability
 - Omitted Means a standard version release

 POSTFIX-ed version numbers may have more features than the non-postfixed version of the same number, but will always have at least the same features and bugfixes.
